# Mobile Editor Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status: Completed Phase 3 (Control Implementation)

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Preparation and Planning
- Analyzed existing components and their structures
- Designed mobile user experience with wireframes
- Established technical architecture for mobile components

### ✅ Phase 2: Base Component Development
- Created `MobileTemplateEditor` as the main container component
- Implemented the `MobileEditModal` system with animations
- Developed the `MobileEditorContext` for state management
- Created the `withMobileEditing` HOC for component adaptation
- Built `MobilePropertyEditor` for property display and editing

### ✅ Phase 3: Specific Controls Development
- Implemented all essential controls for mobile editing:
  - Text: `MobileStringControl`, `MobileRichTextControl`
  - Appearance: `MobileColorControl`, `MobileImageControl`, `MobileFontControl`
  - Data: `MobileDateControl`, `MobileTimeControl`, `MobileLocationControl`, `MobileBooleanControl`
  - Media: `MobileMusicControl`

## Upcoming Phases

### ⏳ Phase 4: Integration and State Management

- [ ] Optimize image loading and processing for mobile
- [ ] Create specialized layouts for different device orientations

### ⏳ Phase 6: Testing and Feedback
- Conduct internal usability testing
- Perform performance testing on various devices
- Validate the complete editing experience
- Gather and implement user feedback

#### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Develop test plan for mobile editor
- [ ] Set up analytics to track user interaction patterns
- [ ] Create feedback mechanism within the app
- [ ] Establish process for prioritizing and implementing changes

### ⏳ Phase 7: Launch and Monitoring
- Create user documentation and guides
- Implement phased rollout strategy
- Set up monitoring and analytics
- Plan for continuous improvement

#### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Create help documentation for mobile editing
- [ ] Set up feature flags for gradual rollout
- [ ] Implement error tracking and reporting
- [ ] Create dashboard for monitoring mobile editor usage

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Begin implementing component preview improvements
2. Start developing the progressive saving system
3. Set up performance testing infrastructure
4. Create basic user documentation for existing functionality

## Timeline Update

Based on our current progress:
- Phases 1-3: Completed (June 2025)
- Phase 4: Estimated completion by mid-July 2025
- Phase 5: Estimated completion by early August 2025
- Phase 6: Estimated completion by late August 2025
- Phase 7: Estimated completion by mid-September 2025

## Resources Required
