# Mobile Time Control Implementation

## Overview
The `MobileTimeControl` is a specialized input control designed for mobile devices that allows users to select time values in a touch-friendly manner. It complements the existing `MobileDateControl` and is optimized for smaller screens.

## Features
- Clean, mobile-friendly time picker
- Support for both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats
- Automatic formatting of time values for consistent data handling
- Display of time in user-friendly format alongside the input
- Handles various time input formats and normalizes them

## Usage
The control can be used in any mobile property editor context where time selection is needed:

```tsx
<MobileTimeControl
  label="Event Time"
  value={timeValue}
  onChange={handleTimeChange}
  format="12h" // Optional: '12h' or '24h' (default)
/>
```

## Implementation Details
The control uses the native HTML time input which presents a mobile-optimized time picker on touch devices. It handles time string formatting to ensure consistency and provides a helper function to display time in user-friendly formats.

## Design Considerations
1. **Simplicity**: The control provides a simple, focused interface for time selection
2. **Format Flexibility**: Supports both 12h and 24h formats to accommodate different user preferences
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid time formats
4. **Visual Feedback**: Displays the selected time in a user-friendly format (for 12h format)

## Integration
The control has been integrated into the `MobilePropertyEditor` component and is now used for all time-related properties in the mobile editor interface, specifically:
- Event time in `EVENT_DETAILS` component
- Event time in `COUNTDOWN` component

## Next Steps
- Consider adding time zone support for international events
- Enhance the visual display with additional time indicators
- Add accessibility improvements for screen readers
